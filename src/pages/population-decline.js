                            Global snowy owl populations used to be estimated at over 200,000 inidivduals, but in 2013 that changed. Their population was re-estimated, and put at 24,000. Since then further re-estimates have put that number as low as 13,000.
                        <br />
                        Climate change, loss of habitat, and dwindling food sources are likely causes of this population decline. But, we also simply donâ€™t know, the snowy owls remote territory make them incredibly difficult to understand.
